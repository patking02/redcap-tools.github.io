Logos for redcap-tools Organization
==============================================

These logos were created by importing the ["baseball cap"](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/baseball-cap_72588#term=cap&page=1&position=36) icon (by [Freepick](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)) into [freeiconmaker](https://freeiconmaker.com) and adding a background and two gradients.  We (redcap-tools org) paid for the commercial (non-free) use, so we didn't have to figure out how to include the correct attributes everywhere.  That's worth $10.  It should be [downloadable](https://freeiconmaker.com/template/RKmA_B2D6l6CUR7tFbWuLT7VeaOXknT-lT6JpbbvGi8).

Hao converted them to svgs to include as a font (https://github.com/redcap-tools/redcap-tools.github.io/pull/12).
