[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redcap-tools/redcap-tools.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redcap-tools/redcap-tools.github.io)

This is the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site behind the https://redcap-tools.github.io.

## Adding projects & resources.

The projects & resources tables on the [Projects](https://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/) are driven by [Jekyll Data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/). Updating these tables simply requires a new row in the appropriate YAML files in the `_data` directory.
